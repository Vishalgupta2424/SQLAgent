SQLAgent is an **AI-powered database assistant** that makes it super easy to talk to your database in plain language.  
No need to remember complicated SQL queries — just type (or even speak) what you want, and SQLAgent will handle the rest.  

The goal is simple:  
👉 To help beginners, non-technical users, and even busy professionals interact with databases without stress.

## ✨ What It Can Do
- **Ask in Your Own Words** → Write queries in natural language and get correct SQL instantly.  
- **Talk Instead of Typing** → Use voice input if you prefer speaking your query.  
- **Instant Execution** → Run generated queries directly on MySQL and see results on the spot.  
- **Know Your Database** → Get a quick view of table names and columns before writing queries.  
- **Multi-Language Support** → Query in different languages, no barriers.   
- **Easy to Grow** → Modular design so new features can be plugged in later.  
- **Learn as You Go** → Each generated SQL comes with a short explanation of what it does.  
- **Never Lose Track** → History of past queries and results for review.
